define brute force attack

brute force attacks can happen online and off line,
when online, a site may try and lock a user out after a certine number of attempt

many companies and the like make a password length range between 4 and 25 charecters
the most commen password length is 8.

brute force attacks can get much more advanced than just the basics, allowing for
faster cracking
this may included: dictonary attacks, rainbow tables, trying common passcodes,
anyilizing the type of hash used (it's complicated)
	an attacker may try and sniff the network (which is when you look through
the flow of traffic) to look for possible passwords to try.
	an attacker may use a bot network to get more computer power

you can find sofware for this for stuff free online. though there are ethical uses
for it.

there are plenty of things you can try and employ to protect from brute force attack
but one of your best defenses is simply to make a strong password

key space: the diffrent types of charecters you use
	incresing your key space will drasticaly increse the amount of time it will take to
crack your passcode. your can use upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers,
& symboles
	incresing LENGTH also makes your password harder to crack.

TIPS & TRICKS for making a securing password
in an ideal world your password would look somthing like this: hU8IO&FTiuy47vg%HF7e
but lets be real, thats a pain and we all know your not actully going to do that so
here are some ways to increse your password sucurety that you may actully do

~ don't make your password: Password1 or 1234 , just don't
~ put capitle letters in the middle of your password, it's easy to make a computer
capitilize the first letter
* so funTimes not Funtimes
~ try capitilizing more than one letter
~ put your number(s) one in from the beginnig or end of your passcode, or both
* monda6y not monday6
~ try using the number 2 or 3 insted of the number 1
* dance2 not dance1
~ try fancy memerable tricks like capitilizing letters that are the same next to
each other (like LL or OO) or turning your E's into 3's becuse they kind of look alike
~ Try turning a memerable (and long) sentence into a passcode and the throw in a number somewhere
and capitilize somethings, this is a pretty good stratagy against dictionary attacks
- but beware of making it too short
- maybe try using an add you have heard WAY too many times
* so: Steve the king of dimonds tried to swim in lava, what a noob ----> stkodTTsilWa7n

so here's an exsample of a more securing but still remeberable password that you may
actally use: yeLLowSno2w
not CIA worthy, but probably better than what your doing right now
